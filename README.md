# Identification-of-Heritage-Monuments


<h3 align="center">Identification of Heritage Monuments using Deep Learning</h3>


## Problem Statement
To identify the monuments from Satellite Images using Deep Learning and Integration of Interpretability for the predicted outcomes (Explainable AI).

## About The Project
The monuments are identified using yolov5 & yolov7 ML framework and deployed in Edge device(Jetson nano).
Explainable AI is also integrated with predicted outcomes for the identified monuments.

## Project Overview

A plenty of heritage monuments are situated all over the world.
Our aim is to identify the heritage monuments from satellite images
To address this problem we developed a deep learning model.
The custom model is developed by using yolov7 object detection ML framework.
We have also deployed our model in Jetson nano developer kit (edge device) with real time input stream.
For the predicted output explainable ai is developed which explains about how the predicted outcome is extracted.
